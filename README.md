## Setting Up Your Site

1. Place the code where your site will reside.
2. Update `define( 'GRAVATAR_EMAIL', 'YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS' );` with your WordPress.com email address.
3. Load it up!

If you don't have a [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com) you can [sign up for one](http://gravatar.com). It's a really cool service and is integrated just about everywhere!
